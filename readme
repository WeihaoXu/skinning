Explanations:
- For the roll mode, the mouse left button need to be kept pressed (like dragging mode), along with pressing left/right arrow keys.

Extra credits:
- Pressing the middle button of mouse when hovering over any bones and dragging will translate the root. 
- I transformed the rotation quaterion and translation vector into dual_quaternions in blending shaders. However, I failed to figure out how to use the dual_quaternion to transform vertex position (do we apply it to vert? ). I applied the dual_quaternion based on two joints separately, and weighted-sumed the position (basically it's still linear blending).
