Done reading joints from model files. Next step is to implement bone selection? Figure out what jid0, jid1 mean.
- In all the provided shaders, jid0 and jid1 only appear in blending.vert. They are used for skinning. 

The draw_line approach for bones is not correct. Should create cylinder geometry for the bones.

The starter code has already provided create_cylinder_mesh() function to create cylinder vertices and faces. It's a cylinder aligning with x axis, ranging (-0.5, 0.5). Inorder to use this cylinder as our bones, we need to translate, rotate and scale it.


- The position and orientation in each joint object are both in world coordinates? 


successfully made use of geometry shader to draw "cylinders". (not really cylinder, but the vertices created by create_cylinder_mesh. Need to transform them into cylinder shape in cylinder_vert_shader)


Spent one hour to debug: pass transform matrix into cylinder shader. Problem: in the lambda for bone_transform_data, returned the pointer of a temporary matrix, which expires once outside the scope!!!
